# Documentation for Belp

## Overview

**Belp (Blockchain hELP)** is a web-based decentralized application (dApp) designed to enhance user engagement and knowledge about Solana-based projects. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, Belp enables users to view Solana projects, get AI-generated insights, and read and write reviews. The application requires wallet connectivity for users to leave reviews and offers the ability to tip reviewers. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the product, its features, and how it integrates with The Grid API.

### 1. Functionalities and Features

#### Viewing Solana Projects
Belp aggregates data from the Solana ecosystem using The Grid API. Users can navigate through various projects, each with detailed descriptions and relevant statistics.

#### AI-Generated Insights
Using Gemini AI, Belp provides users with automatically generated insights on each project. These insights cover various aspects such as project summary, potential risk of the project, goals and vision.

#### User Reviews
Users can read reviews left by others to gauge community sentiment and experiences. To contribute their own reviews, users must connect their Solana wallet.

#### Wallet Connectivity
Wallet connection is facilitated using the Solana Wallet Adapter. This ensures secure and seamless transaction handling, necessary for submitting reviews and tips.

#### Tipping System
Belp allows users to tip reviewers, providing an incentive for high-quality, informative reviews. This is managed through the Solana network.

#### Shareable Reviews
Reviews can be shared on various social media platforms or through direct links, helping to spread information and encourage wider community participation.

### 2. Technical Implementation

#### Next.js
Next.js provides the foundation for the web application, offering server-side rendering and static site generation for improved performance and SEO.

#### TypeScript
TypeScript is used for type safety and to improve code maintainability. It helps in catching errors early in the development process.

#### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is utilized for styling the application. It offers a utility-first approach to CSS, enabling quick and responsive design implementations.

#### Solana Wallet Adapter
The Solana Wallet Adapter handles wallet connections and transactions. It ensures secure interactions between the userâ€™s wallet and the dApp, enabling functionalities like submitting reviews and tipping.

#### PostgreSQL
Currently, user reviews are stored in a PostgreSQL database. This provides reliable and efficient storage and retrieval of review data. Future plans include migrating to IPFS for decentralized data storage.

#### IPFS Integration (Planned)
To enhance decentralization, work is underway to store user reviews on IPFS. This will ensure data integrity and availability, aligning with the decentralized nature of blockchain applications.

#### Gemini AI
Gemini AI generates insights by analyzing data from The Grid API. This integration ensures that users receive up-to-date and relevant information about Solana projects.
